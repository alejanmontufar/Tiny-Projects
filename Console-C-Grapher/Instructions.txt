Hello, wanted to give you some information about how to use this program:

The 'f(x).h' file is for you to introduce the function you want.
At first, you have a parabola f(x) = x^2, but you can change it for any
function you want, with the 'math.h' library you already have in c.
You have to compile it again with the 'compile.bat'.

When you start the program, some text will appear, follow instructions so
it can run properly.

When you see the graph, you can zoom out and zoom in with +, - keys, now
have fun with this little console project!

I did this when I was younger, but I wanted to improve it and I like the final result.
